# Odin-Recipe

This is a simple HTML project created as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course.
The goal of this project is to build a basic website consisting of a main index page and a few linked recipe pages.

Through completing this project, I will demonstrate the following skills:
-Setting up a basic project directory and structure
-Writing semantic HTML
-Linking pages together with anchor tags
-Organizing content clearly using headings, paragraphs, and lists
-Using Git for version control and documenting project progress
